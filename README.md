This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Looking to create a front-end admin panel that will facilitate a Neto eCommerce -> Algolia integration
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/what-is-algolia/

Main goals:
- Users are able to login and input their API credentials
- Select relevant product fields to feed into Algolia
- The ability to intermittently update Algolia

Todos:
- Deploy app to Heroku/Netlify (with SSL)
- Look for disabled products and remove from index
- User Group capability (half baked in).
- Build UI
